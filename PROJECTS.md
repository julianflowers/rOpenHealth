rOpenHealth projects
====================


rPublicHealth is a collaborative project which aims to build R interfaces to all publicly available healthcare and public health APIs as well at to provide R tools to aid quantitative healthcare and public health research.  With this in mind, here are some of the projects that we are planning to set up:

API Wrappers
------------

In development:

* Pubmed (Including tools for systematic reviews via rPubmed)
* ClinicalCodes (via rClinicalCodes.org)

For the future:

* [National library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/api/)
* UK [Office of National Statistics](http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/Info.do?m=0&s=1370378586129&enc=1&page=nde.htm&nsjs=true&nsck=false&nssvg=false&nswid=1366)
* [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/download)
* [Openprescribing](http://www.openprescribing.org/api/doc/)
* ...

[Here](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?apicat=Medical) is a long list of medical APIs that could have R interfaces

Software tools
--------------

In development:

* rCPRD (Tools for interrogating electronic medical record data from [CPRD](www.cprd.com))
* rPubmed (interface for the Pubmed and for systematics reviews)

For the future:

* Tools for other Primary care databases (e.g. [THIN](www.thin-uk.com/), [QResearch](www.qresearch.org))
* ...

If you are interested in working on any of these projects or have suggestions for other future projects that you wish to incorporate into rOpenHealth, you are strongly encouraged to contact us.
